"  575321 added on 11/17/09 > This loan will be used to payoff existing unsecured high interest debt.<br/> 575321 added on 11/18/09 > To further explain, the line of credit I'm attempting to pay off was initially opened two years ago for $22,000.00 for the purpose of debt consolidation.  I've been paying it down steadily (particularly over the last year), but the constantly increasing rate is killing me.  I'm a hard worker who has held two jobs (banker and part-time history professor) for the last seven years.  I'm just trying to get a handle on the interest I'm paying so that I can knock out this debt.  My intention is to pay off all my debt in the next year and half, so that I can go back to school for my second bachelor's degree.  That will make three degrees total (with the bachelor's & master's degrees that I already have).  I'm explaining all of this, so that you can see that I am responsible and dedicated.  This is a good investment, and I assure you that this loan will be paid in full - most likely early.<br/> 575321 added on 11/18/09 > I am the sole wage earner in my household, and I have no dependents.  I have two jobs, which provide me with an annual income of $57,721.00 combined (per 2008 W-2s).<br/>"
